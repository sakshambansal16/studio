## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Cheerful sky blue (#87CEEB). Based on the concept of 'playful', it provides a bright and inviting foundation without being overwhelming.
- Background color: Very pale cyan (#E0FFFF). It maintains the airy, light feeling of the app's overall aesthetic without distracting from the primary elements.
- Accent color: Sunny yellow (#FFD700). As an analogous color to light blue, the accent lands a contrast with a jovial, vibrant effect, drawing focus to key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif font.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for game actions and settings.
- Clean and spacious layout with a focus on readability and ease of interaction.
